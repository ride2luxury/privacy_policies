Zip Technologies (‚ÄúZip,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and safeguard your information when you access or use Zip Wallet, our non-custodial Web3 wallet application, including related features, websites, APIs, and services (collectively, the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù).
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

1. Scope of This Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Zip Wallet mobile app, browser extension, and any associated platforms or services. It does not apply to any third-party websites, decentralized applications (dApps), or services that we do not control. If you interact with a third-party service through our platform, their privacy policy governs that interaction.

2. What We Do Not Collect

Do not collect your private keys, seed phrases, or wallet passwords.


Do not collect or store financial or banking details, except when required for specific services like fiat on/off ramps provided by regulated third parties.


Do not sell your personal information to any third party.


Do not collect unnecessary or intrusive data unrelated to delivering or improving your experience with Zip Wallet.



3. Information We May Collect
We only collect limited personal data required to operate and improve our Services.

You may use VPNs or privacy browsers to limit exposure of IP or geolocation.


You can switch to a custom RPC provider or use privacy-enhanced configurations.



6. Data Sharing
Zip Wallet may share limited data in the following scenarios:
With trusted service providers (e.g., infrastructure hosting, DDoS protection, payment processors) strictly for operational purposes.


With regulatory bodies, when legally required.


With third-party services, but only when you choose to interact with them (e.g., on/off ramps, dApps).


‚úÖ We do not share your data for advertising or monetisation purposes.

7. Security Measures
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including encryption, access control, and data minimization.
üö® However, you are solely responsible for the security of your wallet credentials (seed phrase, private key). We cannot recover lost wallets.

8. Children‚Äôs Privacy
Zip Wallet is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from minors. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it.

11. Third-Party Integrations
Zip Wallet allows interactions with external dApps and services. These third-party platforms operate independently, and their privacy practices are not covered by this policy. We encourage you to read their privacy notices before connecting.

12. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or improvements to our Services. The latest version will always be available on our website or in-app. Material changes will be communicated to you before they take effect.
